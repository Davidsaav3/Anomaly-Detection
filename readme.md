This project focuses on anomaly detection in IoT sensor data contexts using the Isolation Forest algorithm. 
The growing volume of data from IoT devices poses significant challenges for its analysis. Detecting anomalies in this data is essential to identify failures, intrusions or unexpected events that affect the security and performance of IoT systems.
A system capable of processing large volumes of data from distributed sensors has been developed. Performing data cleaning and transformation tasks before applying the Isolation Forest model, which allows the detection of unusual behaviors. In addition, analyzing the results obtained from different data sets with the aim of evaluating the performance of the model under various conditions.
